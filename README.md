# neodim
Neovim plugin for dimming the highlights of unused functions, variables, parameters, and more

This plugin takes heavy inspiration from https://github.com/NarutoXY/dim.lua. The implementation in NarutoXY/dim.lua was a bit inefficient and I saw room for various improvements, including making the dimming an actual LSP handler, rather than an autocmd. The result is a much more polished experience with greater efficiency.
